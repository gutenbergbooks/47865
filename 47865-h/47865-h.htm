      <hr class="short2" />

      <p>This work is intended to explain the plan in operation at the
        Smithsonian Institution, for preparing and stereotyping catalogues; to
        furnish means of judging of its practicability and importance; and to
        serve as a manual for librarians in its execution. The first edition
        was printed in 1852. It was, however, limited to a small number of
        copies, for distribution principally among those who would be likely to
        suggest improvements. The work has, since, been carefully revised, and
        is now published for more general circulation.</p>

      <p>It was a long and difficult task to develop and adjust the details of
        this system, and to make the mechanical arrangements for its successful
        prosecution. The difficulties, both theoretical and practical, have
        been overcome. The actual operation of the plan has shown its entire
        practicability, and warrants the hope that its best promises will be
        realized.</p>

      <p>This book has been stereotyped by a process entirely new, peculiarly
        adapted to the stereotyping of separate titles, or even single lines.
        It has been fully reduced to practice for this special purpose, and
        will doubtless be found, in many other respects, a valuable addition to
        the resources of the art of typography.</p>

      <p>
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_vi" title="[vi]"> </a>
      </p>

      <p>The expense of developing the plan has been borne by the Smithsonian
        Institution. We have every reason to hope that it will promote "the
        increase and diffusion of knowledge among men," and justify the
        continual labor of superintendence. In anticipation, the task proposed
        seems formidable; but it is to be accomplished, <em>title by
        title</em>, on a system, which imposes no heavy burden upon any
        institution, though it offers benefits to all.</p>

      <p>It is not to be supposed that the public will take much interest in a
        work of professional details like this. The subject more particularly
        addresses itself to those who are conversant with the management of
        libraries. Their instruction and experience will enable them to
        estimate aright the difficulty of the undertaking here set forth, and
        to judge, with fairness, of its practical utility.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: The Smithsonian Institution,
        desirous of facilitating research in literature and science, and of
        thus aiding in the increase and diffusion of knowledge, has resolved to
        form a general catalogue of the various libraries in the United States,
        and I submit to you for examination the plans proposed by Professor
        Jewett, librarian of the Institution, for accomplishing this
        object.</p>

      <p>1st. A plan for stereotyping catalogues of libraries by separate
        titles, in a uniform style.</p>

      <p>2d. A set of general rules, to be recommended for adoption by the
        different libraries of the United States, in the preparation of their
        catalogues.</p>

      <p>Professor Jewett will present to you his plans in person, and I beg
        leave, in behalf of the Executive Committee of the Institution, to
        request that you will give this subject that attention which its
        importance demands, and report:</p>

      <p>First. On the practicability of the plan presented.</p>

      <p>Second. On the propriety of adopting the rules proposed.</p>

      <p>You will also confer a favor on the Institution, by giving any
        suggestions with regard to the general proposition of forming a
        catalogue of all the libraries in this country.</p>

        <i>Of the Commissioners appointed to examine the plan for forming a
        general stereotype catalogue of public libraries in the United
        States.</i>
      </p>

      <hr class="short1" />

      <p><span class="smcap">The</span> undersigned were requested, in the month
        of August last, by a letter from Professor Henry, written on behalf of
        the Executive Committee of the Smithsonian Institution, to take into
        consideration the subject of a General Catalogue of the public
        libraries of the United States, proposed to be formed under the
        auspices of the said Institution, and more especially the plan proposed
        by Professor Jewett, Librarian of the Institution, for accomplishing
        that object.</p>

      <p>Having consented to act as Commissioners for the above named purpose,
        the subscribers had several interviews with Professor Jewett, in the
        months of September and October, at which he submitted to them, 1. A
        plan for stereotyping catalogues of libraries by separate, movable
        titles of the books contained in them, and, 2. A set of general rules,
        to be recommended for adoption by the different public libraries in the
        United States, in the preparation of their catalogues.</p>

      <p>Professor Jewett's plan for stereotyping titles on separate plates is
        unfolded at considerable length, in a paper read by him, in the month
        of August last, at the annual meeting of the American Association for
        the Advancement of Science, held at New Haven.</p>

      <p>For a full view of the advantages, both economical and literary,
        anticipated from the adoption of Professor Jewett's plan, the
        undersigned would refer to the valuable and interesting paper just
        named. They will allude briefly to a portion of these advantages.</p>

      <p>The most important of them, perhaps, will be the economy of time,
        labor, and expense, required for the preparation of a new edition of a
        catalogue, to include the books added since a former edition was
        published. On Professor Jewett's plan, when the catalogue of a library
        is published, it will be necessary to strike off only so many copies as
        are needed for present use. When the additions to the library have
        become so considerable as to make another
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_x" title="[x]"> </a>
        edition of the catalogue desirable, or in lieu thereof, a supplementary
        catalogue, (always an unsatisfactory and embarrassing appendage,) the
        new titles only will be stereotyped and inserted in their proper places
        among the former titles, all the titles being on movable plates. The
        pages of the new edition will thus be made up with convenience, and
        every book in the library will stand in its proper place in the
        catalogue. This process will be repeated as often as the growth of the
        library may make it necessary.</p>

      <p>In this way, not only will the plates, used in a former edition, be
        available for each subsequent edition, but when the plan is fairly and
        extensively in operation, most of the titles of books added to any
        given library, of whose catalogue a new edition is required, will, in
        the meantime, have been cast for some other catalogue, and thus
        occasion no new charge for any subsequent use, as far as the expense of
        casting the plates is concerned. The infant state and the prospective
        rapid increase of the public libraries in the United States, as well as
        the frequent founding of new libraries, give great interest to this
        feature of the plan.</p>

      <p>Another advantage of the proposed plan would be of the following
        nature: The libraries in any country, (to some extent, indeed, in all
        countries,) consist partly of the same books. Professor Jewett states
        that, in the catalogues of public libraries of the United States,
        possessed by the Smithsonian Institution, there are embraced at least
        four hundred and fifty thousand titles. He estimates, however, after a
        laborious comparison, that among these there will not be found more
        than one hundred and fifty thousand different titles. It follows, that
        if the plan proposed had been applied to the publication of these
        catalogues, two-thirds of the expense of printing them, as far as the
        cost of plates is concerned, would have been saved, by incurring the
        extra expense of stereotyping the remaining third according to this
        plan. The economy to each particular library, in the expense of plates
        for its catalogue, will be in proportion to the number of books, which
        it may contain in common with any other library, whose catalogue has
        been already stereotyped on this plan. The title of the same book, in
        the same edition, will, of course, be cast but once, and will
        thenceforward serve for the catalogue of every library possessing that
        book, which may enter into the arrangement.</p>

      <p>A third advantage resulting from this plan will be the facility, with
        which a <em>classed</em> catalogue, either of a whole library or of any
        department of it, might be furnished at short notice, without the
        expense of writing out the titles, or of casting new plates, but by the
        simple indication of the selected titles, in the margin of a printed
        alphabetical catalogue.</p>

      <p>Finally, the plan of necessity requires that the titles of the books
        in the libraries, included in the arrangement, should be given on
        uniform principles, and according to fixed rules; an object of no small
        importance to those who consult them.</p>

      <p>
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_xi" title="[xi]"> </a>
      </p>

      <p>These and other incidental advantages, which would result from the
        adoption of his plan of separate stereotype plates, for the titles of
        books in public libraries, are pointed out by Professor Jewett in the
        memoir above referred to, and the undersigned are of opinion that he
        has not overrated their importance. In proportion as the plan is
        concurred in by the public institutions and individuals possessing
        valuable collections of books, the preparation of a general catalogue
        of all the libraries in the country becomes practicable, accompanied by
        references from which it would appear in what library or libraries any
        particular book is contained.</p>

      <p>The undersigned became satisfied, in the course of their conferences
        with Professor Jewett, that the plan in all its parts is practicable.
        In connection with the explanation of its mechanical execution,
        specimens of stereotype plates of separate titles, made up into pages,
        were submitted to them, in common type metal, in electrotype, and in a
        newly-invented composition, the use of which, it is thought by its
        inventor, would be attended with great economy in the cost of plates.
        The undersigned examined these specimens with much gratification and
        interest, but they did not feel themselves competent, from their
        limited opportunities of inquiry, nor did they regard it as falling
        within their province, to form an opinion on the comparative merits of
        these processes. They feel satisfied that no important mechanical
        difficulty is to be apprehended in carrying the plan into full
        effect.</p>

      <p>A majority of the undersigned devoted themselves for several
        successive meetings to the careful consideration of the set of rules,
        submitted to them by Professor Jewett, for the uniform preparation of
        the titles of books. This is a subject which has of late received much
        attention from bibliographers, and is of great importance in the
        formation of the catalogues of public libraries. Professor Jewett's
        rules combine the results of the experience of those who have given
        their attention to the subject in the principal libraries of Europe,
        especially of the British Museum, together with the fruits of his own
        experience and study. These rules appear to the undersigned to be drawn
        up with judgment and care. A few amendments were recommended by the
        undersigned, and a few additions proposed, but they are prepared to
        signify their approval of the system substantially as submitted to
        them.</p>

      <p>In order that a beginning may be made in the execution of the plan,
        under circumstances highly favorable to its success, the undersigned
        take the liberty of suggesting, that it would be advisable for the
        Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to obtain the requisite
        authority, to prepare a catalogue of the library of Congress on the
        above-described plan. A catalogue of this library is now very much
        wanted. Originally constructed on a defective plan, and continued by
        the publication of a large number of supplements, it is now almost
        useless; and as the library increases, it becomes daily more so. The
        preparation of an alphabetical catalogue has in this way become a
        matter of
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_xii" title="[xii]"> </a>
        absolute necessity for the library itself; while it affords the best
        opportunity for commencing an arrangement, by which the various
        libraries of the country will be brought into a mutually beneficial
        connexion with each other, on the plan proposed by Professor
        Jewett.</p>

      <p>The undersigned consider the permanent superintendence of this plan to
        be an object entirely within the province of the Smithsonian
        Institution. They are satisfied that it will tend both to the increase
        and diffusion of knowledge, and they therefore hope, that the sanction
        of the Regents and of Congress will be given to the undertaking.</p>

        id="DIFFICULTIES_IN_PUBLISHING_CATALOGUES">DIFFICULTIES IN PUBLISHING
        CATALOGUES.</h4>

      <p>Few persons, except librarians, are aware of the nature and extent of
        the difficulties, which have been encountered, in attempting to furnish
        suitable printed catalogues of growing libraries; difficulties
        apparently insurmountable, and menacing a common abandonment of the
        hope of affording guides, so important, to the literary accumulations
        of the larger libraries of Europe.</p>

      <p>It is, of course, entirely practicable to publish a complete and
        satisfactory catalogue of a library which is stationary. But most
        public libraries are constantly and rapidly increasing. This
        circumstance, so gratifying on every other account, is the source of
        the difficulties alluded to.</p>

      <p>While the catalogue of such a library is passing through the press,
        new books are received, the titles of which it is impossible, in the
        ordinary manner of printing, to incorporate with the body of the work.
        Recourse must then be had to a supplement. In no other way can the
        acquisitions of the library be made known to the public. If the
        number of supplements be multiplied, as they have been in the library
        of Congress, the student may be obliged to grope his weary way through
        ten catalogues, instead of one, in order to ascertain whether the book
        which he seeks be in the library. He cannot be certain, even then, that
        the book is not in the collection, for it may have been received, since
        the last appendix was printed. Supplements soon become intolerable. The
        whole catalogue must then be re-arranged and re-printed. The expense of
        this process may be borne, so long as the library is small, but it soon
        becomes burdensome, and, ere long, insupportable, even to national
        establishments.</p>

      <p>
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_4" title="[4]"> </a>
      </p>

      <p>There is but one course left—not to print at all. To this no scholar
        consents, except from necessity. But to this alternative, grievous as
        it is, nearly all the large libraries of Europe have been reluctantly
        driven.</p>

      <p>More than a century has passed, since the printing of the catalogue of
        the Royal Library at Paris was commenced. It is not yet finished. No
        one feels in it the interest which he would, if he could hope to have
        its completeness sustained, when once brought up to a given date.</p>

      <p>Dr. Pertz, chief librarian of the Royal Library at Berlin, declares,
        that to print the catalogue of a large library, which is constantly
        increasing, is to throw away money. His opinion is founded upon the
        supposed impossibility of keeping up the catalogue, so as continually
        to represent the actual possessions of the library.</p>

      <p>The commissioners, lately appointed by the Queen of England, to
        inquire into the constitution and management of the British Museum,
        have, in their report, expressed an opinion decidedly against the
        printing of the catalogue at all, and principally on the ground that it
        must ever remain imperfect.</p>

      <p>One of the witnesses, (the Right Honorable J. W. Croker,) examined
        before the commissioners, thus strongly states the case with respect to
        printing:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>"You receive, I suppose, into your library every year some twenty
          thousand volumes, or something like that. Why, if you had a printed
          catalogue dropped down from Heaven to you at this moment perfect,
          this day twelve-month your twenty thousand interlineations would
          spoil the simplicity of that catalogue; again the next year twenty
          thousand more; and the next year twenty thousand more; so that at the
          end of four or five years, you would have your catalogue just in the
          condition that your new catalogue is now [the manuscript part greater
          than the printed part]. With that new catalogue before your eyes, I
          am astonished that there should be any discussion about it, for there
          is the experiment; the experiment has been made and failed."</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Not one European library, of the first class, has a complete printed
        catalogue, in a single work. The Bodleian Library is not an exception.
        It may be necessary to search six distinct catalogues, in order to
        ascertain whether any specified book were or were not in that
        collection, at the close of the year 1847.</p>

      <p>
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_5" title="[5]"> </a>
      </p>

      <p>This is, surely, a disheartening state of things. It has been felt and
        lamented by every one who has had the care of an increasing
        library.</p>

      <h4 id="PLAN_FOR_OBVIATING_THESE_DIFFICULTIES">PLAN FOR OBVIATING THESE
        DIFFICULTIES.</h4>

      <p>As a remedy for this evil, it is proposed to <em
        class="smcap">stereotype the titles separately</em>, and to preserve
        the plates or blocks, in alphabetical order of the titles, so as to be
        able readily to insert additional titles, in their proper places, and
        then to reprint the whole catalogue. By these means, the chief cost of
        re-publication (that of composition) together with the trouble of
        revision and correction of the press, would, except for new titles, be
        avoided. Some of the great difficulties, which have so long oppressed
        and discouraged librarians, and involved libraries in enormous
        expenses, may be thus overcome.</p>

      <h4 id="APPLICATION_OF_THE_PLAN">APPLICATION OF THE PLAN TO THE FORMATION
        OF A GENERAL CATALOGUE.</h4>

      <p>The peculiar position of the Smithsonian Institution suggested the
        application of this plan, on a wider scale, and for a more important
        purpose, than that of merely facilitating the publication of new and
        complete editions of separate catalogues.</p>

      <p>It had been proposed to form a general catalogue of all the books in
        the country, with references to the libraries where each might be
        found. The plan of stereotyping titles, separately, suggested the
        following system for the accomplishment of this important purpose:</p>

      <p>1. The Smithsonian Institution to publish Rules for the preparation of
        Catalogues.</p>

      <p>2. Other institutions, intending to publish catalogues of their books,
        to be requested to prepare them in accordance with these rules, with a
        view to their being stereotyped under the direction of the Smithsonian
        Institution.</p>

      <p>3. The Smithsonian Institution to pay the whole <em>extra</em> expense
        of stereotyping, or such part thereof as may be agreed on.</p>

      <p>4. The stereotyped titles to remain the property of the Smithsonian
        Institution.</p>

      <p>
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_6" title="[6]"> </a>
      </p>

      <p>5. Every library, acceding to this plan, to have the right of using
        all the titles in the possession of the Institution, as often as
        desired, for the printing of its own catalogue, by the Smithsonian
        Institution; paying only the expense of making up the pages, of
        press-work, and of distributing the titles to their proper places.</p>

      <p>6. The Smithsonian Institution to publish, as soon as possible, and at
        stated intervals, a General Catalogue of all Libraries coming into this
        system.</p>

      <h4 id="ADVANTAGES_TO_BE_DERIVED_FROM_THIS_SYSTEM">ADVANTAGES TO BE
        DERIVED FROM THIS SYSTEM OF PREPARING CATALOGUES.</h4>

      <p>The plan of stereotyping the titles, separately, would be of great
        value to every increasing library, independent of any general system.
        Such a library, in the first issue of its catalogue, would be obliged
        to incur an additional expense for stereotyping, which we may, for the
        present, state at fifty per centum above the price for composition.
        But, in the first reprint, both these expenses would be saved; so that
        the whole cost of the two editions would, in this respect, be
        twenty-five per cent. less, if stereotyped.</p>

      <p>Moreover, it would be necessary to print only a comparatively small
        number of copies, when the book, in a more perfect state, could be
        reproduced so easily; much would therefore be saved in paper and
        press-work. Besides, the arrangement of the titles, for a reprint,
        would pass from the hands of the librarian to those of the printer. The
        proof-reading, also, would have been done, once for all. In keeping up
        such a catalogue, the attention and labor of the librarian would have
        to be bestowed only upon additional titles.</p>

      <p>Reckoning, thus, the expense of stereotyping as a part of the
        diminished cost of the first reprint, the saving, for every subsequent
        repetition, would be equal to the whole original cost of composition
        and proof-reading, for the part already stereotyped, and a considerable
        part of that of paper, press-work, and re-arrangement. It is,
        therefore, demonstrable that the economy of the plan would be very
        great, to every library publishing and reprinting its catalogues, even
        without connection with the system proposed.</p>

      <p>
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_7" title="[7]"> </a>
      </p>

      <p>But, in connection with a general system, the advantages of this plan
        would be greatly increased, inasmuch as the same books are to be found
        in many libraries. If the titles, which have been stereotyped for one
        library, may be used for another having the same books, the saving to
        the second would be equal to the whole cost of composition and
        stereotyping of the titles common to the two, added to that of
        preparation of such titles.</p>

      <p>At least one quarter of the titles in any two general libraries, of
        ten thousand volumes and upwards, may safely be supposed to be the
        same. The saving, from this source, to the second library, would,
        therefore, go far towards defraying the extra expense of stereotyping.
        A third institution, adopting the plan, would be likely to find a very
        large proportion of its titles identical with those already
        stereotyped, and the amount saved by the use of these titles, would,
        perhaps, be sufficient to counterbalance the whole extra expenditure
        for stereotyping. At any rate, the extra expense would be constantly
        and rapidly diminishing, and would, probably after the fourth or fifth
        catalogue, cease entirely. The Smithsonian Institution would not,
        therefore, be required to assume the charge of an enterprise, which
        might involve it in great and increasing expense, but merely to
        organize, and to guide a system, which will almost immediately pay its
        own way, and will soon save large sums of money to our public
        libraries.</p>

      <p>That the aggregate economy of this plan would be very great, may be
        seen from the following statement:</p>

      <p>In fifteen thousand pages, mostly in octavo, of catalogues of public
        libraries in the United States, there were found to be more than four
        hundred and fifty thousand titles. But, according to the best estimate
        which could be made, these catalogues contained not more than one
        hundred and fifty thousand <em>different</em> titles. Two-thirds, at
        least, of the whole cost of printing these catalogues (except the extra
        expense incurred by stereotyping the titles which differed) might have
        been saved, by following this plan.</p>

      <p>Having shown its economy when employed by single libraries, and its
        greater economy, in connection with a general system, it is proper to
        suggest a few, among the many benefits to the cause of knowledge, which
        the general adoption of this method would seem to promise.</p>

      <p>
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_8" title="[8]"> </a>
      </p>

      <p>It can hardly be necessary to dwell, at length, upon the benefits to
        be expected from a general printed catalogue of all books in the public
        libraries of America. By means of it, every student in this country
        would be able to learn the full extent of his resources for
        investigation. The places where books could be found, might be
        indicated in the catalogue. A correspondence could be kept up between
        this Institution and every other library in the country. A system of
        exchange and of loans might, with certain stringent conditions, be
        established, or, when the loan of a book would be impracticable,
        extracts could be copied, quotations verified, and researches made,
        through the intervention of this Institution, as effectually to the
        purpose of the student, in most cases, as a personal examination of the
        book. All the literary treasures of the country might thus be made
        measurably available to every scholar.</p>

      <p>Again, this general catalogue would enable purchasers of books for
        public libraries, to consult judiciously for the wants of the country.
        So poor are we in the books which scholars need; so long, at best, must
        we remain in a condition of provincial dependence in literary matters;
        that a responsibility to the whole country rests upon the man, who
        selects books for any public library.</p>

      <p>An important advantage of this system is, that it allows us to vary
        the form of the catalogue, at will, from the alphabetical to the
        classed, and to modify the classification as we please. The titles,
        separately stereotyped, may change their order at command. If, for
        example, it were required to print a separate list of all books in the
        country, on the subject of <em>meteorology</em>, it would merely be
        necessary to check off, in the general catalogue, the titles to be
        used, leaving to the printer the rest of the work.</p>

      <p>Another highly beneficial result would be, the attainment of a much
        higher degree of <em>uniformity</em> than could otherwise be hoped for.
        The rules for cataloguing must be stringent, and should meet, as far as
        possible, all difficulties of detail. Nothing, so far as can be
        avoided, should be left to the individual taste or judgment of the
        cataloguer. He should be a man of sufficient learning, accuracy and
        fidelity, to apply the rules. In cases of doubt, reference should be
        made to the central establishment, to which the whole work should be
        submitted, page by page, for examination and revision. Thus,
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_9" title="[9]"> </a>
        we should have all our catalogues formed substantially on one plan.
        Now, even if the one adopted were that of the worst of our catalogues,
        if it were strictly followed in all alike, their uniformity would
        render catalogues, thus made, far more useful than the present chaos of
        irregularities. The best possible system ought, however, to be the
        object of our aim.</p>

      <p>It is an important consideration, that this plan would greatly
        facilitate the formation of an American bibliography, or a complete
        account of all books published in America.</p>

      <p>By law, a copy of every book, for which a copyright shall be secured,
        in this country, is required to be delivered to the Smithsonian
        Institution, and to be preserved therein. It is hoped, that additional
        legislation, on this subject, will soon lighten the burdens of
        publishers, and secure the observance of this law, <em>in all
        cases</em>.</p>

      <p>The collection of books thus obtained and preserved, will present a
        complete monumental history of American literature, during the
        existence of the law. It is needless to enlarge upon its value, in this
        point of view. If, now, a list of these publications, as they come into
        the library, should, month by month, be published in a <i>Bulletin</i>,
        and the titles immediately stereotyped, the expense would be but
        trifling of issuing, every year, a catalogue of books copyrighted in
        America, during the year, and printing, every five years, a general
        catalogue of American publications, up to that limit. Thus, monthly
        bulletins, annual lists, and quinquennial catalogues would furnish full
        and satisfactory records of American publications.</p>

      <p>Another general consideration is, that this project looks towards the
        accomplishment of that cherished dream of scholars, <em>a universal
        catalogue</em>. If the system should be successful, in this country, it
        may eventually be so in every country of Europe. When all shall have
        adopted and carried out the plan, each for itself, the aggregate of
        general catalogues, thus formed—few in number—will embrace the
        whole body of literature extant, and from them, it will be no
        impossible task to digest and publish a universal bibliography. How
        much this would promote the progress of knowledge, by showing, more
        distinctly, what has been attempted and accomplished, and what yet
        remains to be achieved, and thus indicating
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_10" title="[10]"> </a>
        the path of useful effort; how much, by rebuking the rashness which
        rushes into authorship, ignorant of what others have written, and
        adding to the mass of books, without adding to the sum of knowledge;
        how much, by giving confidence to the true and heroic student, who
        fears no labor, so that it bring him to the height at which he
        aims—the summit of learning, in the branch to which he devotes
        himself; are objects which deserve the hopeful attention of all who
        desire their attainment.</p>

      <h4 id="DISTINCTION_CATALOGUE_AND_BIBLIOGRAPHICAL_DICTIONARY">
        DISTINCTION BETWEEN A CATALOGUE AND A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY.</h4>

      <p>A catalogue of a library is, strictly speaking, but a list of the
        titles of the books, which it contains. It is not generally expected to
        give any further description of a book than the author gives, or ought
        to give in the title-page, and the publisher, in the imprint, or
        colophon; except the designation of form, which is, almost universally,
        added.</p>

      <p>A bibliographical dictionary is supposed to contain, besides the
        titles of books, such descriptions, more or less extended, drawn from
        all available sources of information, as may be necessary to furnish
        means of identifying each work, of distinguishing its different
        editions, of ascertaining the requisites of a perfect copy, of learning
        all facts of interest respecting its authorship, publication,
        typography, subsequent casualties, alterations, etc., its market value,
        and the estimation in which it is held.</p>

      <p>A catalogue is designed to show what books are contained in a
        particular collection, and nothing more. Persons in want of further
        information, are expected to seek for it in bibliographical
        dictionaries, literary histories, or similar works.</p>

      <p>Inasmuch, however, as bibliographical works are not always accessible,
        or known to the investigator, additions are, not unfrequently, made to
        the titles, in catalogues, of such notices as belong more appropriately
        to bibliographical dictionaries, as above described. These, of course,
        impart to such catalogues greater value and usefulness.</p>

      <p>As bibliographers, we cannot indeed but wish, that the catalogue of
        every library were a bibliographical dictionary of its books.
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_11" title="[11]"> </a>
        Practically, however, we must restrict our efforts, within the limits
        of probable accomplishment. There is no species of literary labor so
        arduous, or which makes so extensive demands upon the learning of the
        author, as that of the preparation of such works. The most which one
        man can hope to effect, in this department, is to examine and describe
        books, in some special branch of knowledge, or books of some particular
        class, as <i>palæotypes</i>, books privately printed, a selection of
        books most esteemed by collectors, &amp;c. It is too much to expect,
        that every librarian can find time, or possess learning, for such a
        description of all books under his care. Besides, this would be a waste
        of labor and of money. The same description would be prepared and
        printed, a hundred or a thousand times.</p>

      <p>It is doubtless desirable, that such results of <em>original</em>
        investigations of librarians, as are not to be found in any of the
        bibliographical dictionaries, should be given, in the catalogues which
        they publish. In other cases, also, as will appear hereafter, it may be
        important to give, in a catalogue, fuller and more accurate
        descriptions of books, than are to be found upon their title-pages; but
        the principle should be established, and ever borne in mind, that a
        catalogue, being designed to be merely a list of titles, with imprints
        and designations of size, all additional descriptions should be limited
        and regulated by explicit rules, in order to give uniformity and system
        to the work, and to restrict its bulk and cost, within reasonable
        bounds.</p>

      <h4 id="PREPARATION_OF_TITLES_SO_AS_TO_SERVE_FOR_BOTH">PREPARATION OF
        TITLES SO AS TO SERVE FOR BOTH GENERAL AND PARTICULAR CATALOGUES.</h4>

      <p>It is proposed to prepare and stereotype catalogues of particular
        libraries, in such a manner, that the titles can be used, without
        alteration, for constructing a General Catalogue.</p>

      <p>This requires, that the title of every book be such, as will apply to
        every copy of the same edition.</p>

      <p>If the edition be different, the book is to be considered different.
        In almost every instance, the title also, is different. There are,
        indeed, cases, where the title of a book is the same, in two editions,
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_12" title="[12]"> </a>
        while the body of the work is more or less altered. Such instances are,
        however, of rare occurrence. They are, or should be, recorded in
        bibliographical works. They could only be described by one, who should
        place the two books side by side, and compare them together. In
        general, titles vary with the editions. We may, therefore, in using a
        title transcribed from one copy of a book, for other copies, avoid
        trouble by preparing and stereotyping a new title for every distinct
        edition; treating new editions as new books. So that, if copies of
        various editions of a work exist in several libraries, each will appear
        with a distinct title, in the General Catalogue.</p>

      <p>This method of forming a general catalogue requires, further, that
        <em>peculiarities of copy</em>, which it may be desirable to note in
        preparing the catalogues of particular libraries, should not be stated
        within the titles; but, if at all, in notes appended to the titles, and
        entirely separate from them.</p>

      <p>One copy of the same edition of a book may be on vellum, another, on
        paper; one may be in quarto form, another in octavo; one may have
        cancelled leaves, another, the substituted leaves, another, added
        leaves; some may contain autographs; some, valuable manuscript notes;
        others may be bound by Roger Payne, etc., etc. These are peculiarities
        of copy, and they may be as numerous as the number of copies in the
        edition. They are not noticed in title-pages, and, consequently, would
        not modify the entries in a catalogue, which takes cognizance of titles
        alone.</p>

      <p>The printed matter, which constitutes the book, as a literary
        production, is not altered, in any of these cases, except in that of
        cancelled, substituted, or added leaves. It is indeed true, that,
        occasionally, alterations are made in the body of a book, while it is
        passing through the press: that is to say, after a few copies have been
        struck off, some error may be discovered and corrected, or some word
        may be substituted for another. But, such changes are always slight,
        and can only be detected, by comparing two or more copies of a work
        together. In the case of cancelled leaves, it may, sometimes be
        desirable to print in the general catalogue, the description of rare
        and important copies possessed by particular libraries. But these cases
        would occur comparatively seldom. The rule would be,
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_13" title="[13]"> </a>
        to omit from the title to be stereotyped, all account of peculiarities,
        or defects of copies.</p>

      <p>In cataloguing particular libraries, such peculiarities should be
        stated, upon the card, after the title, but separate from it. They may
        be printed, at the expense of such libraries, in the form of notes to
        their catalogues. The notes for any particular library may be made as
        extensive, as the means of the institution, and the learning and
        leisure of its librarian permit.</p>

      <p>There is another particular, in which the catalogue title might vary,
        in different copies: that, of designation of size. The same book, in
        the same edition, may have copies in quarto, in octavo, and in
        duodecimo. The size of the printed page is, however, in all these
        cases, the same; otherwise, the edition is different. All difficulty,
        on this account, therefore, is obviated, and all confusion of editions
        prevented, by adopting, instead of, or in addition to the usual
        designation of <em>form</em>, as the indication of size, the
        measurement of the printed page, in inches and tenths. Other reasons
        for this mode of marking the size of books, with minute directions,
        will be given hereafter.</p>

      <h4 id="FORM_OF_THE_CATALOGUE">FORM OF THE CATALOGUE.</h4>

      <p>The titles constituting the catalogue may be variously arranged. They
        may be placed under the names of authors, and the names disposed in
        alphabetical order; they may be grouped in classes, according to
        subjects; or they may be made to follow the order of the date, or place
        of printing.</p>

      <p>The two most common forms for catalogues, are the alphabetical and the
        classed. Much controversy has arisen respecting their comparative
        usefulness. It is not necessary to revive it here, since the system now
        proposed, renders it easy to vary the order of titles, so as to suit
        any desired form.</p>

      <p>For the General Catalogue, however, it is, for several reasons,
        desirable to adopt the alphabetical arrangement.</p>

      <p>It would be impossible to propose any system of classification, which
        would command general approval, or upon which a commission of competent
        bibliographers would be unanimous in opinion.
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_14" title="[14]"> </a>
        A classification, founded upon the nature of things, though it has
        occupied the best thoughts of such men as Bacon, Leibnitz, D'Alembert,
        Coleridge, Ampère, and many others, has not yet been attained. Every
        classification which has been proposed or used, is more or less
        arbitrary, and consequently unsatisfactory, and liable to be altered or
        superseded.</p>

      <p>If, however, it were possible to agree upon a system of
        classification, the attempt to carry it out would, in a work like that
        proposed, be fatal to uniformity. Where different men were applying the
        same system, their opinions would vary, with their varying intelligence
        and skill. This would lead to utter and irremediable confusion, and
        would eventually defeat all our plans.</p>

      <p>Even were these objections obviated, the occurrence of fewer
        difficulties in constructing an alphabetical catalogue would still
        present a decisive argument in its favor. Even these are great. If
        increased, by an attempt at classification, they would soon lead to an
        abandonment of the work.</p>

      <p>Another consideration of great weight is, that, in reprinting
        classified catalogues, and inserting additions, if the titles were kept
        in systematic order, the work of selecting those to be used, and of
        distributing them to their places, would have to be done by a person,
        who, besides being a practical printer, should be familiar with the
        bibliographical system adopted. This would be very expensive. Whereas,
        on the alphabetical plan, any printer could do the whole.</p>

      <p>On general considerations, without special reference to those which
        are peculiar to this system of publishing, alphabetical catalogues are
        to be preferred;—catalogues in which all the works of each author are
        placed under his name, and the names of authors are arranged
        alphabetically; anonymous works being entered under the first word of
        the title, not an article or preposition. Such is now the general
        opinion of competent bibliographers and literary men.</p>

      <p>The Edinburgh Review, in an able and interesting article upon the
        British Museum, holds the following language:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>"It seems to have been almost universally agreed that the catalogue
          ought to be alphabetical. Some time ago the current of opinion among
          literary men seemed to be setting towards classed catalogues, or
          those in which the
          <a class="pagenum" id="Page_15" title="[15]"> </a>
          books are arranged according to subjects. We had hardly supposed that
          this illusion (as we hold it to be) had become so nearly obsolete as
          the evidence before us shows that it is: and this disappearance of a
          most injurious opinion, which never was entertained to any extent by
          the really experienced in bibliography, encourages us to hope that it
          will not be long before the <em>professional</em> persons just
          alluded to [librarians] will be admitted to know best on all the
          points which have been raised relative to the care of a large
          library."</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The experience of all students, of all who use books, if carefully
        noted, will show, that, in a vast majority of cases, whoever wishes to
        refer to books in a library, knows the names of their authors. It
        follows, that this form of arrangement must be, in the main, the most
        convenient; and if any other be pursued, it can but accommodate the
        minority, at the expense of the majority.</p>

      <p>Still, it is indisputable that, oftentimes, the names of authors are
        not known; that one knows, merely, what subjects he wishes to
        investigate.</p>

      <p>It may be said, that a catalogue, being designed to be merely a list
        of books contained in a library, is not to be expected to furnish this
        information; and that references to all authors, treating of any
        particular subjects, may be obtained from bibliographical works,
        encyclopædias, and other sources of information. This is true. But,
        unfortunately, these sources of information are not generally known, or
        not readily accessible, even to men of considerable attainments and
        scholarship.</p>

      <p>It becomes, then, a question of importance how far the wants of such
        persons are to be provided for. The following remarks on this subject
        are worthy of attentive consideration:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>"On this, as on other points, we may observe that two descriptions
          of persons consult a catalogue—those who know <em>precisely</em>
          what book they are in search of, and those who do not. The first will
          find by any rule, so soon as they have learnt it; and will be glad
          indeed of a catalogue which preserves its consistency, even though
          600,000 titles, running over four quarters of the globe, four
          centuries of time, and four hundred varieties of usage, should
          actually require <em>ninety-one</em>
          <a class="fnanchor" title="Footnote 1" id="FNanchor_1"
          href="#Footnote_1">1)</a> rules of digestion. The second class could
          easily
          <a class="pagenum" id="Page_16" title="[16]"> </a>
          be suited, if all their imperfect conceptions tended to the same case
          of confusion: and, as being the majority, would have a right to the
          adoption of the one nearly universal misconception; which, being one,
          would furnish a rule. But it is truth which is single, while error is
          manifold; and consequently, it is clear to every common sense except
          that of men of letters claiming, as such, to be bibliographers, that
          one of two things should be done:—either the truth should be taken,
          when known, or in the event of it being possible to be wrong, the
          error should be the consequence of a digested and easily-apprehended
          rule, consistently applied throughout. If the framer of the catalogue
          be allowed to do as he likes, the consulter of it must do as he can.
          Now which of the two classes should be considered in
          preference,—those who know what they want or those who do not? The
          Doctor of Divinity already quoted, gives this as one of his rules:
          'Item, whan anie man comith and wotteth not what he wold haue, then
          he (the keper of the Bokys) shall tell hym, and doe hym to understond
          hys besynesse.' This can be done, to a certain extent, by
          <em>cross-references</em>. But, all cross-references being
          concessions to want of accurate knowledge, it is plain that
          discretionary entries, with discretionary cross-references, would
          form a plan which puts entirely out of the question the convenience
          of the person who knows exactly what he wants; which kills both calf
          and cow for the less deserving son, without giving the power of
          making any answer to the complaint of the one who never fed on husks.
          Nothing is stranger in the course of the evidence before us, than the
          quiet manner in which the opponents of the existing plan take it for
          granted that no one ever goes with a precise knowledge of the
          title-page of the work he seeks, unless it be the coolness with which
          this accurate inquirer is told, as Mr. Carlyle said to those who
          write useful knowledge, that he is one 'whom it is not worth while to
          take much trouble to accommodate.'"</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>But it is convenient even for those to whom the principles and means
        of research are best known, to be able to ascertain, readily, what
        books, of those which they know to have been written upon the subjects
        of their investigation, are to be found in the particular libraries
        which they consult. This end may be attained in the following manner.
        In connection with the <em>catalogue</em> of each library, there should
        be an <em>index</em> of subjects. This index should also be
        alphabetical. Under each subject, the divisions which naturally belong
        to it, should be distinctly recognized. It may here be remarked, that
        the parts of any particular science, or branch of learning, may be
        clearly defined, and universally acknowledged, whilst the relation of
        this science, or branch of learning, to others, may not be clearly
        established. To use the words of a vigorous writer upon
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_17" title="[17]"> </a>
        this subject: "Take a library upon one science, and it classifies
        beautifully, sketching out, to a nicety, the boundaries, which, it is
        too rarely noticed, are much more distinct between the parts of a
        subject, than between one subject and another. Long after the counties
        of England and Scotland were well determined, the debateable land was
        nothing but a theatre of war."</p>

      <p>This index should be alphabetical, rather than classed, because it is
        easier to find a word, in an alphabetical arrangement, than in any
        other order of classification; and, besides, the subject of research
        may be one not admitted, as a distinct division, in any classification.
        Such indexes can hardly be expected, immediately, in connection with
        the general catalogue; though, it is to be hoped, that these valuable
        appendages will not long be, of necessity, omitted.</p>

      <p>A method of securing uniformity in such indexes may, hereafter, be
        agreed upon, so that they may be combined and form an alphabetical
        index of subjects to the general catalogue. It is thought best,
        however, for the present, to limit our efforts to the procuring of good
        alphabetical catalogues, as a groundwork, to which other valuable aids
        to research, may, as opportunities offer, be superadded.</p>

      <h4 id="NECESSITY_OF_RULES_FOR_THE_PREPARATION_OF_CATALOGUES">NECESSITY
        OF RULES FOR THE PREPARATION OF CATALOGUES.</h4>

      <p>The preparation of a catalogue may seem a light task, to the
        inexperienced, and to those who are unacquainted with the requirements
        of the learned world, respecting such works. In truth, however, there
        is no species of literary labor so arduous and perplexing. The
        peculiarities of titles are, like the idiosyncracies of authors,
        innumerable. Books are in all languages, and treat of subjects as
        multitudinous as the topics of human thought.</p>

      <p>Liability to error and to confusion is, here, so great and so
        continual, that it is impossible to labor successfully, without a rigid
        adherence to rules. Although such rules be not formally enunciated,
        they must exist in the mind of the cataloguer, and guide him, or the
        result of his labors will be mortifying and unprofitable.</p>

      <p>In this country, he who undertakes to prepare a catalogue, goes
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_18" title="[18]"> </a>
        to the work under great disadvantages, in many respects. Few have had
        opportunity to acquire the requisite bibliographical knowledge and
        experience; and few libraries contain the necessary books of reference.
        A set of rules, therefore, seems peculiarly necessary for the
        assistance of librarians.</p>

      <p>Minute and stringent rules become absolutely indispensable, when the
        catalogue of each library is, as upon the proposed plan, to form part
        of a general catalogue. <em>Uniformity</em> is, then, imperative; but,
        among many laborers, can only be secured by the adherence of all to
        rules embracing, as far as possible, the minutest details of the
        work.</p>

      <p>The rules which follow were drawn up with great care. They are founded
        upon those adopted for the compilation of the catalogue of the British
        Museum; some of them are, <i xml:lang="la">verbatim</i>, the same.
        Others conform more to rules advocated by Mr. Panizzi, than to those
        finally sanctioned by the Trustees of the Museum. Many modifications
        and additions have been made, adapted to the peculiar character of the
        system now proposed. Some innovations have been introduced, which, it
        is hoped, may be considered improvements. The commissioners, appointed
        to examine and report upon the catalogue project, considered not only
        its general features, but, also, its minute details. To them, were
        submitted the rules for cataloguing, which were separately discussed,
        and, after having been variously amended and modified, were recommended
        for adoption.</p>

      <p>It is too much to suppose that any code should provide for every case
        of difficulty which may occur. The great aim, here, has been to
        establish principles, and to furnish analogies, by which many cases,
        not immediately discussed, may be indirectly settled; and, it is
        believed, that the instances will be few, which cannot be determined,
        by studying the rules, with the remarks under them; and carefully
        considering the characteristics of this kind of catalogue.</p>

      <p>It should be remembered that a principal object of the rules is to
        secure <em>uniformity</em>; and that, consequently, some rules, which
        may seem unnecessarily burdensome, and, in certain applications, even
        capricious, are, all things considered, the best; because they secure
        that uniformity, which is not otherwise possible of attainment, and
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_19" title="[19]"> </a>
        without which, the catalogues could not be comprehended in a general
        system.</p>

      <h4 id="DUTIES_OF_COLLABORATORS_AND_SUPERINTENDENT">DUTIES OF
        COLLABORATORS AND SUPERINTENDENT.</h4>

      <p>The catalogue of each library is to be prepared, in accordance with
        the rules, under the immediate direction of the librarian, by
        transcribers employed by him. Should the system here proposed come into
        general use, it will probably be found expedient to have persons
        specially trained to the business, who shall go from place to place,
        for the purpose of making catalogues. Much of the value of the work
        will, of course, depend upon the faithfulness and learning of those who
        first prepare the titles. The qualifications, both natural and
        acquired, demanded for the suitable accomplishment of their task, are,
        unfortunately, rare. No person, who is impatient, indolent, inaccurate,
        or careless in his personal habits; who is ignorant of literary history
        and bibliography; who is unacquainted with the classical, and with the
        most important modern languages; or who is destitute of that general
        knowledge of the circle of the sciences, which is attained in, what is
        usually called, a liberal education; can be expected to make a
        catalogue of a general library, that will not be discreditable to the
        compiler, and to the institution employing him. Great care should,
        therefore, be exercised in selecting men for such work.</p>

      <p>It is proper to remark, in this place, that no one, whatever may be
        his talents, attainments and industry, can safely work with the
        rapidity, which the public, and committees (inexperienced in
        catalogue-making, however judicious and well-instructed in other
        matters) frequently require. It is impossible to say what would be a
        good average rate of performance, in cataloguing a library, without
        knowing exactly the kind of works it contains. The best and only
        satisfactory criterion is furnished by the rate of progress in the
        British Museum, the National Library of Paris, and other large
        libraries containing books of all kinds. A trial of many years has
        shown that men possessed of the best qualifications, long practised in
        the work, with every advantage of a systematic division of labor, of
        access to all necessary books of reference, and to persons who
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_20" title="[20]"> </a>
        could help them in emergencies, provided with every mechanical facility
        and assistance to be desired, can prepare about forty or fifty titles a
        day.</p>

      <p>The danger of working with too great rapidity, without rules, and
        without suitable bibliographical preparation, was most strikingly
        illustrated during the discussions of the British Museum Commission.
        The following account of the particular instance alluded to is
        extracted from an article in the Edinburgh Review for October,
        1850:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>"Mr. Payne Collier, the secretary of the Commission, undertook to
          show how the Museum catalogue <em>should</em> be made, without
          reference to any preceding one. Mr. Collier prepared, according to
          his own views, twenty-five titles, done in an hour, of books from his
          own library, and with which he was therefore previously well
          acquainted. They were handed to Mr. Panizzi, with the full consent of
          the writer, and an invitation of criticism. Mr. Payne Collier is
          known to our readers: but to 'excuse the tone of confidence' he
          assumed, he described himself, in handing over these slips, as having
          attained a certain reputation in letters and particularly in
          antiquarian literature. The description is as correct a one as could
          be looked for from Mr. Collier himself: and the Society of
          Antiquaries, the Shakspeare and Camden Societies, and the Royal
          Society of Literature could inform the public, if need were, that he
          did not overrate himself. Moreover, his confidence was proved and
          supported by the most explicit dealing: he willingly lent those of
          the books he had described which were not in the Museum library, and,
          after the criticism to which we are coming, he offered no plea of
          haste. On the contrary, when a contemporary journal, of opposite
          views to our own, called them, by way of extenuation, his 'hurried
          slips,' he wrote a public letter in correction of the designation,
          maintaining that they were 'not hurried in any sense of the word,'
          and adhering to the defence, presently to be noticed, which he had
          circulated among the Commissioners in a private pamphlet.</p>

        <p>"Mr. Panizzi put these slips into the hands of Mr. Jones, his senior
          assistant, requesting him to report upon them. The report was as
          follows:</p>

        <blockquote>

          <p>'These twenty-five titles contain almost every possible error
            which can be committed in cataloguing books, and are open to almost
            every possible objection which can be brought against concise
            titles. The faults may be classed as follows:—1st. Incorrect or
            insufficient description, calculated to mislead as to the nature or
            condition of the work specified. 2nd. Omission of the names of
            editors, whereby we lose a most necessary guide in selecting among
            different editions of the same work. 3rd. Omission of the Christian
            names of authors, causing great confusion between the works of
            different authors who have the same surname—a confusion
            increasing in proportion to the extent of the catalogue. 4th.
            Omission of the names of annotators. 5th. Omission of the names of
            translators. 6th. Omission of the number of the edition, thus
            rejecting a most important and direct evidence of the value of a
            work. 7th. Adopting the name of the editor as a heading, when the
            name of the author appears in the title-page. 8th. Adopting the
            name of the translator as a heading, when the name of the author
            appears on the title-page. 9th. Adopting as a heading the title or
            name of the author merely as it appears on the title-page—a
            practice which would distribute the works of the Bishop of London
            under the
            <a class="pagenum" id="Page_21" title="[21]"> </a>
            names Blomfield, Chester, and London; and those of Lord Ellesmere
            under Gowan, Egerton, and Ellesmere. 10th. Using English or some
            other language instead of the language of the title-page. 11th.
            Cataloguing anonymous works, or works published under initials,
            under the name of the supposed author. Where this practice is
            adopted, the books so catalogued can be found only by those who
            possess the same information as the cataloguer, and uniformity of
            system is impossible, unless the cataloguer know the author of
            every work published anonymously or under initials. 12th. Errors in
            grammar. 13th. Errors in description of the size of the book. We
            have here faults of thirteen different kinds in twenty-five titles,
            and the number of these faults amount to more than two in each
            title. A large proportion of them, moreover, is of such a nature
            that it would be impossible to detect them when the written title
            is separated from the book; for example, Mr. Collier has catalogued
            an edition of the Odyssey, with a Latin title, as though the title
            were in Greek. A mere perusal of Mr. Collier's title would not lead
            any person to suspect the existence of such a blunder. [I may say
            (says Mr. Panizzi), by way of parenthesis, that when I saw this
            Odyssey, printed at Oxford, with a Greek title, I sent everywhere
            to try to find it. I had one with a Latin title of the same year,
            and of the same size, but I could not be sure that it was the same.
            I sent to Oxford; I made all sorts of inquiries; nobody knew such
            an Odyssey with a Greek title; but still this was negative
            evidence, until I begged the favor of Mr. Collier to show me the
            book itself from which he drew up his title. The title is in Latin,
            therefore the idea created by his title, that there was another
            edition of the Odyssey in the same year and of the same size, at
            Oxford, is wrong; there was only one.] Two editions of Madame de
            Stael's work on the French Revolution appeared at Paris in 1818;
            but Mr. Collier's title making no mention of the edition, the
            inference would arise that the copy to which it referred was of the
            <em>first</em> rather than of the <em>second</em> edition. It is a
            fallacy to say that errors can be corrected on a subsequent perusal
            of the titles or in print, unless that perusal be an actual
            comparison of the title with the book. [In fact, in the case of the
            Odyssey with the Greek title, the title looked to all intents and
            purposes very correct, but it was not correct.] Where we see such a
            result as is shown above, from an experiment made by a gentleman of
            education; accustomed to research, and acquainted with books
            generally, upon only twenty-five works, taken from his own library,
            and of the most easy description, we may form some idea of what a
            catalogue would be, drawn up, in the same manner, by ten persons,
            of about 600,000 works, embracing every branch of human learning,
            and presenting difficulties of every possible description. The
            average number of faults being more than two to a title, the total
            is somewhat startling—about 1,300,000 faults for the 600,000
            works; that is, supposing the proportion to continue the same. But
            it must be borne in mind that the proportion of errors would
            increase with the number of titles; that to errors in drawing up
            each individual title would be superadded the errors which would
            unavoidably occur in the process of arranging the titles, and
            subsequently in the printing. In short, I humbly conceive that it
            would be impossible to prove the inexpediency of Mr. Collier's plan
            more effectually than he has himself done; and I hope I may add,
            without giving offence, that, had I seen these titles under any
            other circumstances than the present, I should have concluded that
            the object was to show how nearly worthless would be a catalogue,
            the proposed advantages of which were short titles, drawn up and
            printed within the shortest possible period of time.'</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>"Mr. Jones then proceeded to a detailed proof of his assertions. In
          a case of this kind, we are inclined to think that Mr. Collier should
          have had a reply: but the question is complicated, for though here
          assailed, he was an assailant, and moreover was an officer of the
          court who had been permitted to make himself a partizan, and to
          support his own views by circulating pamphlets among the judges,
          which a sense of official propriety prevented Mr. Panizzi from
          answering in the same way. Mr. Collier did answer in a pamphlet
          addressed to the Commissioners, as well as (recently) in the journal
          alluded to. The answer does not deny one iota of Mr. Jones's
          imputation: it merely protests against being tried by Mr. Panizzi's
          rules. 'I intended,' says Mr. Collier, 'my English mode of
          cataloguing to be diametrically opposed to his foreign mode, which
          might do well enough for stationary or retrograding countries, where
          want of enlightenment is at this hour producing the most lamentable
          <a class="pagenum" id="Page_22" title="[22]"> </a>
          consequences, but which was totally unfit for this country, where
          inquiry is active, where education is daily extending, and which
          mainly owes to the spread of education<a class="fnanchor"
          title="Footnote 2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2">2)</a> the
          happiness and tranquillity it enjoys. Nothing therefore could be more
          obviously unjust than <em>to test my titles by Mr. Panizzi's
          rules</em>. I discarded them altogether; I threw them overboard at
          once, and <i xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>....'</p>

        <p>"We are English as well as Mr. Collier; but we do not see that
          progress and enlightenment are essentially connected with bad
          bibliography at two errors and a fraction per title. Neither do we
          think Mr. Collier's defence more valid than would be that of an
          incorrect arithmetician who should attribute the rules to Cocker or
          Walkingame, and protest against the jurisdiction. Mr. Panizzi's
          rules, like all other codes, contain offences divisible into <i
          xml:lang="la">mala in se</i> and <i xml:lang="la">mala prohibita</i>:
          Mr. Collier justifies his departures from the morals of bibliography,
          by alleging his right to differ from Mr. Panizzi about its
          expediencies. He leaves out an author's Christian name, or
          substitutes his translator for him, and says he is not bound to
          follow Mr. Panizzi's foreign modes: and therein he resembles those
          reasoners who have defended false inference by renouncing Aristotle.
          But his own argument may be turned against him: it is a strong
          presumption in favor of the materiality of Mr. Panizzi's rules, that
          so able an opponent finds himself under the necessity of implying the
          following alternative—either those rules, or such bibliography as
          is seen in <em>this</em> rejection of them. We dwell the more upon
          this point because we observe that some of the journals adopt the
          defence, and say in terms that what Mr. Panizzi calls errors are
          deviations from his own ninety-one rules. Are we really to believe
          that, if Mr. Collier had chosen to spell authors' names backwards, it
          would have been a sufficient answer to an objection from Mr. Panizzi,
          that the plan of writing them forwards was one of his own rules?
          According to Mr. Collier and his defenders, <em>English grammar</em>
          is only one of Mr. Panizzi's foreign modes, repudiated by English
          common sense."</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>But the most elaborately formed rules for cataloguing are inadequate
        to provide for all cases. Doubts and difficulties will unavoidably
        arise, as to their application. For example, in abridging titles,
        scarcely any two men would agree, even within the limits of the rules
        given. It is necessary, therefore, that there should be a central
        superintendence of the whole enterprise; and that the duties of those
        who are engaged in preparing the titles, and of the superintendent
        should be distinctly understood. This object has been kept in view in
        preparing the rules. The transcribers are to be responsible for
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_23" title="[23]"> </a>
        exactness, in writing off titles without abridgment; and for a clear
        statement, in notes, of all peculiarities not mentioned in the titles.
        They should also indicate the parts of the titles which they think
        might be omitted.</p>

      <p>The titles are then to be submitted to the superintendent. He is to
        examine them, in order to see that all the rules have been observed. He
        is to decide upon all abridgments and additions, and mark the
        manuscript for the printer. He is also to examine the last revise.</p>

      <h4 id="PRINTING_AND_STEREOTYPING">PRINTING AND STEREOTYPING.</h4>

      <p>The printing should all be executed in one office, under the immediate
        eye of the superintendent. The same type, and the same style of work
        should be used in all parts.</p>

      <p>It is not necessary, upon this plan, to finish a catalogue in
        manuscript, before beginning to print. Titles may be prepared and
        stereotyped without regard to their future arrangement. The work of the
        printer may keep pace with that of the transcribers. Should it be
        desired, a catalogue might be published in parts, each comprising a
        particular class of books.</p>

      <p>The titles, after having been set up in type, and corrected with the
        utmost care, are, before stereotyping, to be sent to the library to
        which they belong, to be revised, by a comparison with the books
        themselves. This arrangement implies the necessity of a large fount of
        type, and of promptness on the part of librarians.</p>

      <p>The titles are then to be stereotyped, each upon a separate plate, or
        block. The headings (if they be names) are to stand on plates distinct
        from the titles. This is required, in order to avoid repeating them for
        each title. They must be separate from the titles, that other titles
        may, if occasion require, be interposed.</p>

      <p>Every name, or other word, used as a heading, is to be printed, in the
        title, in small capitals; thus each stereotyped title will show, at a
        glance, the heading under which it belongs.</p>

      <p>Each title is to have upon it a running number, according to the order
        of its being stereotyped. The use of this number is for reference to
        the <em>Local Index</em> of the general catalogue, in which
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_24" title="[24]"> </a>
        the libraries, where the books are to be found, will be designated.
        When the catalogue is made up, these numbers will not be in connection;
        but in the index, they will follow each other in consecutive order, and
        should there have, printed against each, the names of the several
        libraries containing the book. These numbers will further serve to show
        the extent and progress of the work.</p>

      <p>Copies of the titles stereotyped will be kept at the Smithsonian
        Institution, arranged in their numerical order; so that in referring to
        any particular title it may not be necessary to copy the title in full,
        but merely to give the number attached to it.</p>

      <p>It will sometimes happen, that words, which, according to the rules,
        are used as headings, do not occur in the titles. There would, then,
        without further provision, be no means of ascertaining, from an
        examination of the plate itself, its order in the collection. To meet
        this case, the expedient has been adopted, of setting up the word to be
        used as the heading, in the margin of the title, and in shorter type,
        which will then show itself upon the plate, but not upon the printed
        page.</p>

      <h4 id="PRESERVATION_AND_USE_OF_THE_PLATES">PRESERVATION AND USE OF THE
        PLATES.</h4>

      <p>When the titles have been stereotyped, and the plates ascertained to
        be in perfect working order, they are to be arranged alphabetically,
        and kept on sliding shelves, or shallow drawers, placed as near to each
        other as possible. The catch-letters of the titles may be marked upon
        the front of each shelf, so as to admit of alteration as the changing
        of the plates may require. The ranges of shelves may be so disposed as
        to form deep and narrow alcoves. A room of fifty feet by forty would
        accommodate the plates of upwards of a million titles, which may, in
        this manner, be kept in very compact and perfect order, and, at the
        same time, be easily accessible.</p>

      <p>It may not be amiss to add, that the material, which it is proposed to
        employ in the stereotyping, is much less expensive than common type
        metal; so cheap, indeed, that the whole expenditure on this account,
        even for so large a collection, would be of small importance. It is,
        besides, much lighter than type metal, more convenient in handling, and
        requires fewer, and less expensive fixtures. It is not
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_25" title="[25]"> </a>
        at all affected by dampness, or by any ordinary elevation of
        temperature.</p>

      <p>The plates are mounted, for printing, upon blocks similar to those
        ordinarily used for stereotype plates, but with continuous clamps
        extending the whole length of the page. The breadth of page adopted is
        such as is suitable for a work in octavo, or in double columns in
        quarto or folio. The latter form (folio double columns) will probably
        be found most convenient, as well as most economical, for large
        catalogues. Presenting more titles upon a page, it enables a student to
        examine and compare, with greater facility, the various works of an
        author. It requires also less paper and press-work for the same number
        of titles. These considerations have led to the general adoption of the
        folio form for catalogues of large libraries. To these it may be added,
        in the present case, that in folio pages it would be practicable to
        avoid the division of titles between lines, without occasioning
        observable irregularities in the length of the pages.</p>

      <h4 id="METHOD_OF_USING_THE_STEREOTYPED_TITLES">METHOD OF USING THE
        STEREOTYPED TITLES IN THE FORMATION OF NEW CATALOGUES.</h4>

      <p>In concluding these details of the system of stereotyping catalogues,
        by separate titles, it now remains to say a few words upon the method
        of employing the titles, in the construction of new catalogues.</p>

      <p>Whenever, after the publication of one catalogue, upon this plan, it
        should be proposed to form a catalogue of another library, the first
        step would be to ascertain, which of the titles of such library have
        been already stereotyped; for these need not again be transcribed.</p>

      <p>This may be done in the following manner. A copy of the catalogue
        already published, together with a copy of any titles which may have
        been subsequently stereotyped, should be sent to the cataloguer, who as
        he takes a book from the shelf should first seek for its title among
        those already printed. If a title, strictly identical with that of the
        book, be found, it should be marked in the margin.</p>

      <p>When titles occur, which he does not find among those already printed,
        they are to be written, each on a card or slip of paper, according to
        the rules; and, as the work goes on, sent, in parcels, to be
        stereotyped.
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_26" title="[26]"> </a>
        When the cataloguer has gone through the library in this manner, he is
        to return the printed catalogues, in the margin of which he has marked
        the common titles. The printer will then be able to select and combine
        the plates to be used for this particular catalogue, impose them, print
        the requisite number of copies, and distribute them to their
        places.</p>

      <p>After the catalogues of several libraries shall have been thus
        prepared and printed, they will be combined to form a general catalogue
        of those libraries, and thus the labor of selecting common titles will
        always be limited within narrow bounds.</p>

        performance of which, uniformity is highly important; it is therefore
        desirable that all abridgments be made by the same person. To this end,
        the rule should stand without exception, so far as the writing out of
        the titles is concerned. The abridgments for printing should all be
        made by the superintendent, and only in the following cases:</p>

      <p>Additions to names of authors, &amp;c., not necessary for their
        identification; mottoes, repetitions, or expletives not essential to a
        full and clear titular description of the book, may be omitted.
        Omissions of mottoes and devices are to be denoted by three stars; of
        other matter, by three dots, placed thus ...</p>

      <p>No omission is to be made which requires any change in, or addition
        to, the phraseology of that part of the title which is retained. Not
        even an improvement of the title, by any change, is to be allowed.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 1.</span> This rule is understood to apply
        only to the principal entry. It is supposed that each title will be
        entered in full only once. All other entries will refer to this full
        entry. They will be called <em>Cross-References</em>; and rules for
        their preparation are given hereafter.</p>

      <p>
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_30" title="[30]"> </a>
      </p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 2.</span> It is necessary (in this plan) to
        give the name of the Author, in connection with the title, although it
        be but a repetition of the heading; for the heading will be stereotyped
        separate from the title, and, therefore, the title should contain all
        that is necessary to indicate its proper position, in the alphabetical
        order, in case of displacement.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 3.</span> Experience shows that it takes
        less time to transcribe titles in full, than to abridge them with any
        tolerable degree of accuracy. It requires, too, less learning and
        experience in the cataloguer. That a catalogue can be made more
        rapidly, more economically, and more satisfactorily by transcribing the
        titles faithfully and fully, without the omission of a single letter or
        point, than by any proper plan of abridgment, cannot be denied by any
        one who has fairly tried the experiment.<a class="fnanchor"
        title="Footnote 3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3">3)</a> If the
        catalogue were not to be printed, this rule should have no exception
        whatever. The printing, however, introduces two considerations to
        modify the rule, namely, the <em>expense</em> of printing, and the
        <em>bulk</em> of the catalogue. The force of the former consideration
        is much diminished by the plan of stereotyping the titles. It is but a
        first expense that we have to meet, not a repetition of it. Besides, no
        library but the first has to print all its titles. The saving, even to
        the second library, by the use of those already stereotyped, would
        doubtless far more than counterbalance the extra expense of printing
        long titles. The bulk of the catalogue is certainly a matter of
        considerable importance, though of less than might, at first, be
        supposed. It does not make much difference, in convenience of use,
        whether such a work as an Encyclopædia be in a hundred volumes or in
        ten, though it is, of course, more convenient to refer to one volume
        than to ten. The proposed general catalogue would doubtless exceed one
        volume, even with short titles. But convenience should not be allowed
        to have more influence than the demands of learned investigators. The
        bulk of catalogues should not be considered in opposition to their
        accuracy, and to such a degree
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_31" title="[31]"> </a>
        of fulness of title, as may be necessary to identify the book, and to
        give all such particulars of information, as may justly be expected
        from a titular description.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 4.</span> It is deemed unnecessary to
        prescribe any particular form of card or paper for use in copying the
        titles. If they are to be printed at once, it will be found most
        convenient to write them on one side only of common foolscap paper.
        Cross references should immediately follow the titles to which they
        belong. If cards have already been adopted in the library to be
        catalogued, their form need not be changed. They may be placed in the
        hands of the printer without being transcribed. A manuscript catalogue
        for constant use should generally be upon cards. A very convenient
        method of keeping them is that employed by Mr. Folsom in the Boston
        Athenæum. The cards are long and narrow; are so perforated that they
        may be strung upon cords, which, being elastic, allow free motion
        without displacement; and are kept in cases, made to resemble folio
        volumes, one side of which opens like the cover of a book.</p>

      <div class="rule">

        <p id="RULE_II" class="hang_ind">II. The Titles are to be transcribed
          <em class="smcap">with exactness</em>.</p>

      </div>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 1.</span> The titles are <em>not to be
        translated</em> by the cataloguer. If, however, the original title,
        being in a language which does not admit of being represented in the
        Roman character, be accompanied by a translation into a language for
        which the Roman alphabet may be used, the latter may be given without
        the former; this peculiarity being mentioned, with such explanations as
        will prevent mistake as to the language in which the book is printed.
        If the book be in several languages, and be provided with title-pages
        for each, or for several, the cataloguer may give the preference to
        languages using the Roman alphabet in the following order: English,
        Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, German. The other title-pages should
        however be mentioned.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 2.</span> The <em>precise phraseology</em>,
        however quaint, awkward, or ungrammatical, must be scrupulously
        followed. When striking faults or errors occur, the cataloguer should
        write [<i class="addition_to_the_title">sic</i>], after each of them,
        to denote that the title has been faithfully copied, and that the error
        is not attributable to his carelessness.</p>

      <p>
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_32" title="[32]"> </a>
      </p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 3.</span> The exact mode of
        <em>spelling</em>, however inaccurate or antiquated, must be
        conscientiously copied. When abbreviations appear upon the title-page,
        they should, in transcribing, be copied accurately. They should also,
        if possible, be printed. These are most frequent in early printed Latin
        and Greek books. If types cannot be had for printing these
        abbreviations, the word should be given in full; the added letters
        being italics.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 4.</span> The <em>punctuation</em> of the
        title-page should also be retained. Sometimes, in the titles of modern
        books, no pointing is used; in such cases, none should be introduced.
        Wide spaces may be used instead.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 5.</span> The <em>accentuation</em> of the
        original should be preserved. In French books, however, it often
        happens that parts of the title-page are printed in capitals without
        accents, and other parts in "lower-case" letters with accents. This is
        attributable to the general want of accents upon what are called
        "title-letters." To avoid the striking incongruity which would be
        occasioned by printing one part with, and another without accents, when
        the same letter is used throughout the title, it will be proper to add
        the accents, where they are omitted in the titles of foreign books; but
        not to omit or alter any which occur.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 6.</span> When possible, the <em>form of
        letter</em> (as Black Letter, Italic, Greek, Hebrew, &amp;c.), is to be
        preserved. When Black Letter, Italic, or any peculiar letter or cut of
        type is used, in the title, merely as a typographical embellishment, it
        is not to be copied; but only when the whole book is printed in it.
        This rule has no limitation, except the knowledge of the cataloguer,
        and the means of the printing office. With reference to those languages
        in which is embodied the great mass of literature, there will be little
        difficulty in finding men to copy the titles with accuracy; and the
        printing office should contain varieties of type, Roman, Black Letter,
        German, Greek, Hebrew, and, in time, fonts of other alphabets.</p>

      <p>Books in languages which cannot, at first, be correctly printed or
        written, should be reported from each library, as accurately and fully
        as possible. An arrangement may hereafter be made to employ competent
        persons to catalogue such works, and means may be procured
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_33" title="[33]"> </a>
        for printing or engraving their titles. No title, however, should be
        stereotyped for the General Catalogue, till its accuracy and conformity
        to the rules are fully ascertained.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 7.</span> This principle does not apply to
        the <em>use of capitals or small letters</em>. Most title-pages are
        printed wholly in large letters; some are partly in large and partly in
        small letters. For the catalogue, they are to be written and printed in
        small letters.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 8.</span>
        <em>Initial capitals</em> are to be used only when the laws of the
        language now require them. In English, the first word of every
        sentence, proper names, adjectives derived from proper names, names of
        the Deity, the first word of the title of a book quoted within another
        title, and titles of respect or office, such as Hon., Mr., Dr., Capt.,
        Rev., (whether contracted or not,) prefixed to a name, should be
        written and printed with initial capitals. In German and Danish, every
        noun begins with a capital. In French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese,
        adjectives derived from proper names, are not, as in English, generally
        printed with initial capitals. In Latin, the English usage in this
        particular should be followed. It would doubtless be more satisfactory
        to make the titles, as printed in the catalogue, perfect transcripts of
        the title-pages, in respect to the use of initial capitals; but this is
        hardly practicable. The use of both upper-case and lower-case letters
        in a title-page, is for the most part a matter of the printer's taste,
        and does not generally indicate the author's purpose. To copy them in a
        catalogue with literal exactness would be exceedingly difficult, and of
        no practical benefit. In those parts of the title-page which are
        printed wholly in capitals, initials are undistinguished. It would be
        unsightly and <del class="deletion">un-undesirable</del>
        <ins class="correction" id="corr_1">undesirable</ins> to distinguish
        the initials where the printer had done so, and omit them where he had
        used a form of letter, which prohibited his distinguishing them. It
        would teach nothing to copy from the book the initial capitals in one
        part of the title, and allow the cataloguer to supply them in other
        parts. The only practicable method of securing uniformity or
        convenience would seem to be, to require, as is done above, the
        cataloguer to employ initial capitals according to established laws,
        regardless of the title-page.</p>

      <p>There are certain features of title-pages which it is wholly
        impracticable
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_34" title="[34]"> </a>
        to transfer to a catalogue. For example, they generally are (as they
        always should be) <em>inscriptions</em>, and as such are meant to have
        a certain <em>local disposition</em> of parts which serves to interpret
        them, by showing at a glance their relations to each other. A title in
        a catalogue cannot be expected to retain this important feature of an
        inscription.</p>

      <div class="rule">

        <p id="RULE_III" class="hang_ind">III. The whole Title is to be
          repeated for every distinct edition of the work; and the number of
          the edition, if not the first, is to be always given.</p>

      </div>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 1.</span> The necessity of this rule arises
        from the stereotyping of the titles separately. It is frequently the
        case, that publishers, after having stereotyped a book, call every
        thousand copies of it a separate edition, and, for twenty or more
        editions, there may be no alteration in the book, except in the word
        expressing the number of the edition, and in the date. In such cases,
        it cannot be necessary to print a separate title for each pretended
        edition. If there be any important alteration of the book, it should be
        designated as a distinct edition. This irregularity is found mostly, if
        not exclusively, in American books, and occurs principally in
        school-books.</p>

      <p>It is easy to see how this artifice of bibliopoles would occasion
        great trouble to cataloguers, if it were common. Some publishers have
        introduced the terms "second thousand," "tenth thousand," &amp;c.,
        instead of "second edition," "tenth edition." This is more honest, and
        for our purposes more convenient. But it is not necessary to introduce
        these chiliads into the catalogue.</p>

      <p>Minor changes are sometimes made in the stereotype plates, after a
        part of the copies have been printed; that is, some error may be
        discovered and corrected, or some word substituted for another. But
        such changes are generally slight and unimportant. They can only be
        detected by comparing one copy of a book with another, and, when known,
        are seldom worthy of notice.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, the title of a book is the same in two editions, while the
        body of the work is more or less altered. Sometimes, also, the title is
        changed while the book remains entirely unaltered. Such
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_35" title="[35]"> </a>
        instances are, however, of comparatively rare occurrence. They are, or
        should be, noted in bibliographical dictionaries. It is not often the
        case, that the two editions are to be found in one library;
        consequently, an account of such variations cannot be expected from the
        cataloguer. But, if such facts become known to him, they should be
        carefully noted.</p>

      <p>The increase of the bulk of the catalogue, which this rule will
        occasion, may appear, at first sight, to be a grave difficulty. It
        should be considered, however, that the number of books, which reach a
        second edition, is comparatively small; and, that, although there may
        be a hundred editions of a book, those only will have their titles
        repeated, which belong to the library to be catalogued. The increase in
        bulk will be much less considerable than might be apprehended, and it
        will be more than compensated for, by the greater exactness of the
        descriptions. Any one, who has had much experience in examining
        catalogues, must have been frequently puzzled to ascertain the exact
        character of several editions of a book, where the only description of
        any edition after the first, is "<cite>The same</cite>," or
        "<cite>Ditto</cite>," with a different date. We may wish to know
        whether the titles are identical. In the title of a later edition, some
        particular may have been given, which to us is very important, but
        which the cataloguer has omitted. To bibliographers, and men of habits
        of careful investigation, different editions are different books, and
        they should be always described, in catalogues, as particularly as if
        they were independent works.</p>

      <div class="rule">

        <p id="RULE_IV" class="hang_ind">IV. Early printed books, without

          brackets; to which are to be added the words of the colophon,

        described with great minuteness by bibliographers, particularly by

        refer to their works in cataloguing such books.</p>

      <p>These books generally have at the beginning a head-title, which
        contains a sufficient description of the book, while in the colophon
        the place of publication, name of the printer, date, &amp;c., are
        given; but sometimes the book begins with a table, or dedication, or
        register, and has no colophon. In such cases, not unfrequently, there
        is a title at the end of the table, or in the dedication. In short, so
        great is the variety of cases, that it would be extremely difficult, if
        not impossible, to give rules applicable to them all. The rule given

        <p>Should either of these particulars be omitted in the title-page, the

        <p>In accordance with general usage, the fold of the sheet, as folio,
          quarto, octavo, when it can be ascertained, is to be stated. As an
          additional, and more exact designation of size, the <em>Height and
          Breadth of the first full signature page</em> (the folio and
          signature lines being omitted in the measurement) are to be stated in
          inches and tenths, the fractions being expressed decimally.</p>

      </div>

      <p><span class="smcap">Explanation 1.</span> The librarian should use a
        small square or rule, marked with inches and tenths. The first number
        given should represent the height, and the second, the breadth of the
        page. In the catalogue, the measurement would be recorded thus:—</p>

      <p class="center"> 8º (7.3×4.2)</p>

      <p>that is, fold of sheet, 8vo; measuring, 7 inches and 3 tenths in
        height, by 4 inches and 2 tenths in breadth.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Explanation 2.</span> When the first signature
        page is not a full page, or when it has foot notes, turn to the first
        succeeding signature page which is full and without notes.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Explanation 3.</span> When there are no signatures,
        measure the first full <i xml:lang="la">recto</i> page. If the other
        pages vary much from the standard page, add <cite>irr.</cite> for
        <cite>irregular</cite>.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Explanation 4.</span> Marginal rules and side
        marginal references and notes are not to be regarded in the
        measurement; some editions may be printed with and some without them.
        But such marginal references should be mentioned.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Explanation 5.</span> Catch-words generally stand
        upon the signature line, and are therefore not to be counted. The
        measurement of height should, however, comprise all printed matter
        below the folio
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_40" title="[40]"> </a>
        line, and above the signature line. By folio line is meant that upon
        which stands the number of the page.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span> The designation of the form is
        added to the titles of books in catalogues for two purposes: to enable
        one to distinguish between different editions of the same book, and to
        convey to those who have not seen the book, some idea of its size.</p>

      <p>The fold of the paper has been universally adopted, as the measure of
        size. A sheet once folded, forming two leaves, or four pages, is a
        folio. A sheet twice folded, forming four leaves or eight pages, is a
        quarto. A sheet three times folded, forming eight leaves, or sixteen
        pages, is an octavo. A sheet so folded as to form twelve leaves, or
        twenty-four pages, is a duodecimo. And so on.</p>

      <p>But this method of designating the size of a book is inexact and
        frequently deceptive; because, 1st, it is not always possible to
        ascertain the fold; and, 2dly, the fold, when ascertained, gives no
        definite indication of the size or shape of the book.</p>

      <p>In many books one can tell, at a glance, the fold of the sheet; but it
        is unsafe to rely upon this first impression. Examination of signatures
        is indispensable. Sometimes, it is necessary to examine also the
        water-lines and water-marks. Occasionally, all these will fail us.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Signatures</em> are letters or figures placed at the bottom of the
        first page of each sheet, as guides to the binder, to denote the order
        of the sheets. The signatures of the different forms from folio to
        32mo, would regularly be placed as follows:</p>

      <p>But sometimes the paging of the book begins in the midst of a
        signature; in such cases the signatures would fall on pages different
        from the above, throughout the book, though the intervals would be
        regular. Double signatures are sometimes placed upon stereotype plates,
        to enable printers to impose them either as octavos or duodecimos.</p>

      <p>Besides the principal signatures, there are subordinate signatures,
        which, as they do not help to distinguish the size of the book, but are
        only used to aid the binder, are omitted in the above table.</p>

      <p>It will be seen from this table, that the signatures are precisely the
        same for 8vos, in half sheets, as for 4tos; for 16mos, in half sheets,
        as for 8vos; for 24mos, in half sheets, as for 12mos; for 32mos, in
        half sheets, as for 16mos.</p>

      <p>Printers impose in half sheets or sheets, according to their
        convenience. Of course, therefore, from the signatures <em>alone</em>,
        it is impossible to distinguish between 4tos and 8vos, 8vos and 16mos,
        12mos and 24mos, 16mos and 32mos. It is generally easy to determine the
        fold by the size and shape of the book, but (as we shall show
        hereafter) not <em>always</em>.</p>

      <p>Signatures do not occur in the earliest printed books; but as this
        class of books is small, and very particularly described by Panzer,
        Hain, and others, there is but little difficulty in ascertaining the
        precise description of them.</p>

      <p>Books may be quired in printing, that is, several sheets may be put
        together, like the sheets in a quire of paper. In this case the
        principal signature is the same as if the whole formed only one sheet.
        A folio may thus be undistinguishable from an 8vo, by the signatures
        alone.</p>

      <p>When signatures fail us, resort may sometimes be had to the water
        lines, which, by holding the paper up to the light, may be seen
        crossing the sheet perpendicularly, in the folio, 8vo, 18mo, 24mo, and
        32mo; and horizontally, in all the other forms less than 32mo;
        sometimes, also, in the 24mo. The water-mark is a device
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_42" title="[42]"> </a>
        of the manufacturer, placed in the middle of the half sheet, and
        distinguishable in the same way as the water-line. In the folio, this
        occurs in the middle of the page; in the quarto, in the back or fold of
        the book; in the 8vo, at the upper and inner corner. At the present
        day, however, printing paper is seldom made with water-lines or
        water-marks.</p>

      <p>In examining a book, all these means of determining its fold
        occasionally deceive the most skilful bibliographer. If sheets of paper
        had, from the first, been always made of the same size, there would be
        comparatively little difficulty. But they have always varied so much,
        that a very small 8vo is often in no way distinguishable, in
        dimensions, from a large 16mo. Many other sizes also are liable to be
        confounded.</p>

      <p>The following measurements, in inches, of a leaf of folio, octavo, and
        16mo, of foolscap, medium, and imperial paper, will show how impossible
        it would be, from the size of the book to determine the fold of the
        sheet, even of paper of what are called the regular sizes, particularly
        when the books have been cut down in binding:</p>

        made of almost any and every size and shape, and it is no longer
        possible to distinguish, with accuracy, the different folds. Books,
        which, judged by the eye, would be supposed to be quartos, are, in
        reality, duodecimos; books which might be supposed to be octavos, are
        16mos, &amp;c. The signatures, as we have seen, will not inform us
        whether a book is an 8vo, or a 16mo on half sheets. There are no
        water-marks to help us; nor is it possible in any way to tell.</p>

      <p>If it be thus difficult, and often impossible, to ascertain the fold
        with the book before us, of what use can it be, as a designation of
        size, to those who have only the description? This is a difficulty
        which has but commenced. It is becoming more serious every year. It is
        more serious in America, than in other countries, for in Europe, there
        is much more regularity in the sizes of paper than here.</p>

      <p>On these accounts, it has been thought desirable, if not
        indispensable, to introduce some new method of designating the size of
        books. The measurement of the printed page has seemed the readiest and
        most useful. The trouble of measuring is much less than might, at first
        sight, be supposed, and the time occupied by it is hardly worthy of
        consideration.</p>

      <p>It would be, for all purposes of bibliography, better to make this the
        universal method of designating the size of books. It would save
        numberless blunders and frequent perplexity; and, upon the whole, would
        take less of the librarian's time, than the ordinary process of
        ascertaining the fold, provided that be done with exactness.</p>

        doubtless, be enhanced by giving the number of pages in every volume,

        xxvi+345+<span class="smcap">xlv</span></cite>, meaning 26 pages of
        prefatory matter, 345 pages in the body of the book, and 45 pages of
        appendix. But the disproportionate amount of additional labor, as well
        as of increase in the bulk and cost of catalogues, which such
        enumeration and notation would demand, renders it necessary to limit the
        object of this rule, which is to show whether the work described be
        merely of pamphlet size.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 2.</span> Prefatory matter is not to be
        included in the enumeration of pages. But if it be something more than

          to be printed in italics, and between brackets; to be in the English
          language, whatever be the language of the title; to be such only as
          are applicable to all copies of the edition described, and necessary

        within brackets, they are to be in the vernacular of the author,
        whatever be the language of the title; and, if the name be used for the
        heading, the part supplied in the title is to correspond in typography
        with the rest of the name; that is, to be printed in small
        capitals.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 1.</span> It is not always easy to say what
        additions are necessary, to render a title satisfactorily descriptive.
        A title is often a mere name, arbitrarily chosen by the author. It is
        sometimes allegorical, or embodies, in a pun, or conceit, or covert
        allusion, some indication of the subject-matter of the book. In such
        cases, it was not designed to be descriptive of the work, and could not
        be made so, without destroying its character. Explanations of such
        titles may be thought desirable; but if so, they should be given in
        notes, and separate from the titles themselves. A title should be the
        briefest possible designation of the contents of a book. It should
        cover everything which the book contains, but in the most general
        terms, without minute specifications. Mindful of this definition, we
        shall frequently find cases, where the title, intended to be
        descriptive, fails to give us what we have a right to expect. A book
        may be in a different language from the title-page. It may be in
        several languages, while the title indicates but one. It may contain an
        important Preface, Introduction, or Biography of the author, by another
        hand, not mentioned in the title. In these, and in many other cases,
        additions to the titles may be necessary.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 2.</span> There are many cases, however,
        where it seems desirable to give further information concerning a work,
        than could be given within the title, under the restrictions of the
        preceding paragraph. The title may be a misnomer, or it may contain
        allusions, which it is desirable to explain. The book may be a rare and
        valuable

        one, with maps and illustrations, the number and description of which
        ought to be given. It may have been privately printed, or limited to a
        small number of copies, or prohibited, or condemned to be burnt. The
        edition may be the <i xml:lang="la">Editio princeps</i>, or a
        fac-simile of an early edition, or a surreptitious or spurious edition;
        or it may be identical, except in the title, with what purports to be
        another edition, or an independent work. These facts belong, more
        properly, to a bibliographical dictionary, than to a catalogue. It is
        proper, however, that they should be noted by cataloguers. They may,
        also, be printed, at the discretion of the superintendent, but
        generally, in the form of separate notes, rather than as additions to
        the titles.</p>

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark 3.</span> Peculiarities of copies, such as
        large paper, satin paper, vellum; also notes, autographs, cancelled
        leaves, substituted leaves, mutilations and alterations; binding in a
        different number of volumes from that indicated in the title, or
        ascertained by the rule already given, &amp;c. &amp;c.,—these, and
        other peculiarities or imperfections of copy, relate only to particular
        copies, and therefore should not be noticed in a title intended to
        apply to the whole edition. Every cataloguer should, however, note
        every such thing, after the title. The note may be printed in the
        catalogue of the library containing the book described, but not,
        usually, in the title for the General Catalogue.</p>

      <p><cite>Mc</cite>, and <cite>M'</cite>, abbreviated forms of

        <p>(2.) French surnames preceded by the preposition <cite>de</cite> are
          to be catalogued under the name itself, and not under the prefix.</p>

      <p>Thus: <cite>Florian (Jean Pierre Claris de)</cite> is to be placed

      <p>In this respect, usage is by no means uniform among French authors.
        Thus, Brunet places <cite>D'Alembert</cite> under <cite>D</cite>, while
        Quérard, the Editors of the "Biographie Universelle," etc., place the
        same name under <cite>A</cite>. But consistency is of the first

        <p>(3.) French surnames preceded by <cite>De la</cite>, are to be

      <p>It is better to make this the invariable rule, although uniformity

      <p>The family name of an individual is to be considered that which he
        has, or adopts, for himself and his descendants, rather than that which
        he received from his ancestors,—<em>his</em> family name, not <em>his
        father's</em>. Now if a man's name have been changed, by his own act,
        the name assumed is supposed to be that by which he wishes to be known
        to his contemporaries, and which he wishes to transmit to posterity. A
        married woman generally drops her maiden name, and assumes that of her
        husband. By this, therefore, she should ever after be known. If she
        published books under her maiden name, and afterwards under her married
        name, they should all be recorded under her married name, with a
        cross-reference from the former. It may be that she published only
        under her maiden name; in this case, her works should be entered under

      <p><span class="smcap">Remark.</span> The catalogue, thus formed, will be
        composed of works, having each a distinct title-page and an independent
        pagination. Doubtless, greater convenience and usefulness might be
        attained by adopting a more comprehensive plan;—one, by which every
        distinct article in Transactions of Learned Societies, in Magazines,
        Reviews, and similar works, where, by the rule of the publication,
        <a class="pagenum" id="Page_52" title="[52]"> </a>
        the authors of the treatises are named,—should be separately entered,
        as if it were a book. Such an attempt is, however, at present,
        unadvisable. Should it, hereafter, be thought practicable to extend the
        rule, none of the titles which have been prepared, under this rule,
        will be superfluous, and none will have to be altered. It is hoped,
        that, within a few years, such progress may be made in the General
        Catalogue, as to justify the attempt at greater minuteness of
        registration.</p>

        will relieve librarians from an almost incalculable amount of labor,
        perplexity and dissatisfaction. It will relieve readers from every
        inconvenience, except that of sometimes being obliged to look in two
        places for the book. On these accounts, a simple, arbitrary rule is the
        only one that can safely be adopted. Any rule for selecting the most
        prominent word of a title, or for entering a book under the name of its
        subject, would be found fatal to uniformity; it would greatly increase
        the trouble of making a catalogue; it would not render the catalogue
        more convenient for readers, but, in the main, much less so. The only
        objections to the proposed rule are, that it brings many titles under
        words of little significance, as a "<cite>Brief</cite> Survey", a
        "<cite>Succinct</cite> Narrative", &amp;c., and that it brings many
        titles together, under such words as "Essay", "History", "Narrative",
        &amp;c. These objections have been fully considered, and the rule is
        given with the settled conviction that the inconveniences alluded to
        are much less than those which would result from any other rule or set
        of rules, which have been proposed, or can be devised.</p>

          constructed upon the general principles of the preceding rules.</p>

        <p>(1.) In cataloguing <em class="smcap">Maps and Charts</em>, the full
          title is to be given, including the names of surveyors, compilers,
          engravers, publishers, &amp;c.; date and place of publication; and
          number of sheets composing the map. Each edition is to be separately
          recorded, and the separate title of each sheet, when it varies from
          the general title. The titles of sub-sketches are to be introduced at
          the close of the main title, within brackets, and to be given in
          full, including authorship, scale and size.</p>

        <p>(2.) The scale is to be given in all cases. When not stated on the
          map, it is, if possible, to be derived from it.</p>

        <p>
          <a class="pagenum" id="Page_63" title="[63]"> </a>
        </p>

        <p>(3.) The size of the map, within the <em>neat-line</em> of the
          border, is to be given in inches and tenths. When a map has no
          printed border, the measure of the limits of printed surface is to be
          given.</p>

        <p>(4.) The price, if stated on the map, should be copied.</p>

        <p>(5.) All important peculiarities of copy, such as the kind of paper,
          and whether backed, folded, bound, on rollers, &amp;c., should be
          mentioned in a note.</p>

        <p>The titles thus prepared are to be arranged under the names of the
          countries, or divisions of the earth's surface delineated in the
          maps; and these names are to be disposed in alphabetical order, with
          the cross-references necessary to facilitate research.</p>

        <p>(6.) <em class="smcap">Engravings</em> are to be recorded under the
          names of the engravers, with cross-references from those of the
          painters or designers. The date, and the name of the publisher, if
          found upon the print, should also be given. The size of the print, in
          inches and tenths, should also be stated. If the copy be an <del
          class="deletion">artists'</del>
          <ins class="correction" id="corr_2">artist's</ins> proof, or a
          remarkably good impression of a valuable engraving, the fact should
          be stated in a note.</p>

        <p>(7.) <em class="smcap">Music</em> is to be entered under the name of
          the composer. If the work have a distinctive title, there should be a
          cross-reference from that.</p>

        EXAMPLES.</h3>

      <hr class="after_h" />

      <p>The following examples are introduced, for the purpose of illustrating
        the rules, and of furnishing specimens of different kinds of titles, as
        well as of showing the general appearance of the proposed catalogues.
        In some respects, these are not average specimens; but have been
        selected, partly on account of their containing difficulties. Some
        titles would require a large number of cross-references. Only so many
        are here inserted as are necessary for the purpose of illustration.</p>

      <p>It has not been convenient to give examples of titles in languages
        which use other than Roman letters. Our printing-office is not yet
        supplied with the requisite variety of type. For the same reason, in
        some of the titles, words are spelled in full, which, in the books, are
        printed with signs of abbreviation. There is a branch of this invention
        which promises to furnish us with the means of engraving, with
        facility, any desired characters, and of stereotyping them from the
        engraved plates.</p>

      <p>The application of the rules to the examples will, in most cases, be
        sufficiently obvious, but, it may not be amiss to make some
        explanations respecting a few of them.</p>

      <p>Rule 1 to 3. The examples illustrating these rules need not be
        specially pointed out. Abridgments are frequent; but the rules for
        omissions could not be illustrated without giving a great number of
        full titles, with abridgments of the same. When an author has only one
        Christian name, the full name is supplied, if not given in the title;
        when more than one, the initials not given are supplied. Errors in
        titles, even to accidental faults in punctuation, have been
        scrupulously copied.</p>

      <p>Rule 4. See the titles under <a href="#PLINIUS">

      <p>INDEX OF SUBJECTS.</p>

      <p>An index of subjects, applicable to these titles, has been prepared
        for the purpose of furnishing a specimen of what is proposed for the
        catalogue. This general index may be printed separately; being of
        itself, a compact and convenient guide to the contents of the Library.
        Such an index affords, as will be seen, the opportunity for making a
        much more minute and useful classification of titles than is
        practicable in a classed catalogue.</p>

      <p>LOCAL INDEX.</p>

      <p>This is intended to furnish an illustration of the method, described
        on <a href="#Page_23">page 23</a>, of designating the various
        libraries, where any work is to be found, the title of which is in the
        catalogue. This index will be an indispensable accompaniment to a
        general catalogue. The references given in the present case are, for
        the most part, supposititious.</p>
